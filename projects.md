Below you'll find all my past and present projects that I felt are worth listing. Feel free to browse and shoot me an email if you have any questions.

## [Pirates Fantasy League](https://github.com/mikeyfreake/piratesfl)
A site for managing the history of your fantasy football league. Keep track of season stats, champions (and losers), power rankings, and your league constitution. This is a work in progress.

Initally I was planning to make this such that anyone could signup and add their league, but my initial focus is now to get this working my league. Once complete, I plan on extending it so that League Managers can share their particular league with friends and even allow  League Members to maintain their own stats.

Implemented with jHipster (Spring, Hibernate, Liquibase on the back, AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap on the front).

## [Simple SDLC](https://github.com/mikeyfreake/simplesdlc)
Just that, a basic implementation of SDLC with Products, Releases, Sprints and Stories. It can be used to track your effort and plan your releases.

Implemented with jHipster (Spring, Hibernate, Liquibase on the back, AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap on the front).

## [Fantasy Feed](https://github.com/mikeyfreake/piratesfl)
A simple single page app for aggregating and searching RSS news feeds. I've defaulted the page to include a few NFL feeds, but the page could easily be used for aggregating any RSS feed.

Implemented using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap.
